  "body": "# Meiosis\r\n\r\nMeiosis is a library and an architecture pattern for dividing a web application into small,\r\nindependent, manageable, and testable parts.\r\n\r\nThe key principles of Meiosis are:\r\n- remain small and simple, allowing you to build components with minimal effort\r\n- provide an architecture to structure your code that scales well as your application gets larger\r\nand more complex\r\n- let you use the libraries that you prefer\r\n- provide functionality out of the box, but allow you to swap implementation details if need be.\r\n\r\nMeiosis is currently under active development. Once the design and API have stabilized, more\r\ndocumentation and resources will be produced.\r\n\r\nExamples will be added to: https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-examples\r\n\r\nMeiosis is developed by [foxdonut](https://github.com/foxdonut)\r\n([@foxdonut00](http://twitter.com/foxdonut00)) and is released under the MIT license.\r\n",
